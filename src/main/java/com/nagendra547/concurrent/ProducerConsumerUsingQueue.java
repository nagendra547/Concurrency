/**
 * In Java, the object itself is the entity that is shared between threads which
 * allows them to communicate with each other. The threads have no specific
 * knowledge of each other and they can run asynchronously. They run and they
 * lock, wait, and notify on the object that they want to get access to. They
 * have no knowledge of other threads and don't need to know their status. They
 * don't need to know that it is thread2 which is waiting for the resource â€“
 * they just notify on the resource and whomever it is that is waiting (if
 * anyone) will be notified.<br>
